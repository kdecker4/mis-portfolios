I went into college undecided as far as my major goes, I then decided in my sopohmore year that I wanted to study Finance. I wanted a degree within the field of Business, but also felt that Finance awould be an interesting side of business to work in. The advisors did a great job of helping me with my class selection, and was able to knock out a lot of requiremnts with minimal classes, leaving me with leftover credits. The advisors told me it would be a good idea to double major due to this availability of credits, and gave me the options of marketing, entrepreneuership and MIS. I chose to try MIS because I feel that technology is an extremely important skill to have, and would provide a lot of value to my skillset and potential opportunities.  I am excited to learn more about technology, and fully immerse myself in the content of the class!
